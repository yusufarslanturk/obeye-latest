# If OBSEYE frontend is available on the internet, it is suggested to disallow
# access to it for robots like search engine crawlers. Otherwise they may
# overload the OBSEYE system without offering any benefit.
#
# Note that this must not be used for security reasons, as any visitor is
# free to ignore the contents of this file or use it to know which directories
# are supposed to be hidden.
#
# The following configuration should be used if OBSEYE frontend is installed
# in the root directory of the web server. It will deny access to OBSEYE
# frontend for all robots.
